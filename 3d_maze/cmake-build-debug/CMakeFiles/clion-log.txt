CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findepoxy.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "epoxy", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "epoxy" with any of
  the following names:

    epoxyConfig.cmake
    epoxy-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "epoxy" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "epoxy_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "epoxy"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
